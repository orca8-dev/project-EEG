We are determined to work on this neurotech project and contribute to the community, some of our findings and creations using research done previously. 

## Primary focus

Creating and sustaining a framework for EEG data collection using an EEG headgear and creating our own custom database for any kind of researches based on EEG physiological signal.

## Work progress

Research papers study related to EEG physiological signals: Done (continued throughout the project)

Comparative study of consumer level EEG headgear document: Done  [Docs]

Exploration of various datasets and research papers available: Done

Implemented the conversion of raw bdf EEG data into a preprocessed data format such as .dat (python) or .mat (matlab): Done

Selection of EEG headgear: To be done

Documentation study and framework creation for RAW EEG signal processing and capturing: WIP (Work In Progress)

Headgear and hardware study: To be done

## Current status

Working on DEAP database and implement Emotional Analysis using python language
